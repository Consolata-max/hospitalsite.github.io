            <p> About us
Kiriaini Mission Hospital is owned and managed by the Catholic Diocese of Murang’a. It was started by the Consolata sisters in 1955 as a small dispensary then developed to a maternity wing and later to a general hospital with a capacity of 72 beds. Since inception, the Hospital has grown over the years and currently has an official Government approved bed capacity of 72 distributed in the following wards; Gynecology and maternity, pediatric, Medical wards and surgical rooms and private/amenity ward. It is situated in Mathioya sub-County, Murang’a County.
The Hospital is located at Kiriaini Market and connected to three tarmac roads heading to Murang’a, Kangema and Nyeri. The nearest main hospitals are Murang’a District Hospital and Nyeri provincial General Hospital, at a distance of 32km and 25km from us respectively. Othaya and Kangema sub district hospitals, which are about 10km and 13km respectively, have been upgraded to a District Hospital.
In February 2003, the hospital was closed down due to low number of patients, which in effect resulted to financial difficulties. Later in the year, His Lordship Rt. Rev. Peter Kihara Imc. the then Bishop of Catholic Diocese of Murang’a approached the superior General of Assisi Sisters of Mary Immaculate of India to offer assistance in the day to day running and administration of the hospital. In the month of October 2003, the first group of five sisters arrived at Kiriaini Mission Hospital. The hospital was reopened on 20th November 2003.There are three sisters in number currently in the Hospital; Sr. Sheena Josse, Sr. Dona Mary, and Sr. Josna.
In July 2020 ,the hospital added a new hospital block to aid in  better  provision of services to its patients.</p>
